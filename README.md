# Login-Form
A login form is common component of many applications whether they are web based, desktop and mobile. It serves as the gateway for users to access the features and functionalities of that particular application by verifying their identity through required credentials.

<br> In this mini project, I create a responsive login form. At first, a sign-up page will be displayed, and user have to enter each and every field of it. On successful sign-up it will redirect to a login page, where user can login by providing the correct email-id and password.<br>

<br> Language used - Python <br>
<br> Here I use python tkinter. Tkinter is a built-in Python module for creating graphical user intefaces (GUI). It provides a set of widgets and tools to build desktop applications.<br>

<br> Tkinter is based on Tk GUI toolkit, originated as part of TCL (Tool Command Language) programming language but later has been ported to Python language<br>
